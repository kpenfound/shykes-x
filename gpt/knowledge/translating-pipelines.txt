how to translate dagger pipelines across languages (shell, go, python, typescript)

The dagger shell is just one frontend to the dagger API. Other frontends are the Dagger Go SDK, Typescript SDK, and Python SDK. These SDKs offer generated bindings for making the same API calls in a native way.

If you understand how to run dagger pipeline in any of these languages, you can translate them one-to-one by simply reading examples in the target language, and transposing 1-to-1.

You can find examples of using a Dagger SDK in the source code of a module.
See "reading the source code of a dagger module".
