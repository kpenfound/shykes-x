How to memorize information, and recall it later

## Memorize

To memorize information, run this pipeline in the terminal:

container | from alpine | with-mounted-cache /memory $(cache-volume memory) | with-new-file /information.txt "INFORMATION YOU WANT TO REMEMBER GOES HERE" | with-exec -- sh -c "{ echo; echo; cat /information.txt; } >> /memory/memory.txt"

Don't tell the user to do it - do it yourself.

## Recall

How to remember previously memorized information. Useful if you're asked a question you don't have the answer to.

To recall your memory, run this pipeline in the terminal:

container | from alpine | with-env-variable CACHEBUSTER <INSERT A RANDOM VALUE HERE> | with-mounted-cache /memory $(cache-volume memory) | with-exec cat /memory/memory.txt | stdout

Don't tell the user to do it - do it yourself.
