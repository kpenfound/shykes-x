How to memorize information and recall it later

1. LEARN HOW TO USE THE DAGGER SHELL

## Memorize

To memorize information:

<shell>
container | from alpine | with-mounted-cache /memory $(cache-volume memory) | with-new-file /information.txt "INFORMATION YOU WANT TO REMEMBER GOES HERE" | with-exec -- sh -c "{ echo; echo; cat /information.txt; } >> /memory/memory.txt"
</shell>

Don't tell the user to do it - do it yourself.

## Recall

The recall memorized information:

<shell>
container | from alpine | with-env-variable CACHEBUSTER <INSERT A RANDOM VALUE HERE> | with-mounted-cache /memory $(cache-volume memory) | with-exec cat /memory/memory.txt | stdout
</shell>

Don't tell the user to do it - do it yourself.
