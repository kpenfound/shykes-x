how to interact with git repositories. learn the terminal first.

1. LEARN HOW TO USE THE DAGGER SHELL

First, ask yourself: do I want the raw data in the git repository, or do
I want to load it as a Dagger module and discover its API? If the repository
(or subdirectory) has a dagger module, it's worth loading it just in case.
Fallback to "regular" git operations.

1. Git repository as module

To load a git repo as a module, see "how to use modules"

<example>
github.com/dagger/dagger | .doc
github.com/shykes/x/gpt | .doc
</example>

2. Git repository as "dead" data

The core function 'git' can interact with git remotes.
Use the usual shell exploration techniques to discover the exact API.

<example>
git https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser | head | tree
git https://github.com/dagger/dagger | tags
git https://github.com/cubzh/cubzh | branch main | commit
git https://github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules | head | tree | glob '**'
</example>
