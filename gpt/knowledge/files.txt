FIRST LEARN HOW TO USE THE DAGGER SHELL

Dagger is functional. Shell commands are functions that receive immutable arguments and return an immutable scalar or object.
Functions can be chained in this way, creating pipelines.

This is applied to filesystem operations. File and Directories are standalone immutable objects.

<example>
directory | with-new-file hello.txt 'Hello, world' | with-directory ./src $(git https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser | head | tree)
</example>

TIP: when writing file content, don't write "\t" for tabs or "\n" for newlines, the shell doesn't interpret them.
