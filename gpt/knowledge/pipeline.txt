What is a pipeline in dagger?

In Dagger, function calls can be chained to form a pipeline.
Each function returns a certain type. If that type is an object, it may contain more functions,
which can be called, and so on. Each function call has its own arguments.

This is similar to bash pipelines, except with typed artifacts flowing through the functions,
rather than unstructured text streams flowing through the bash commands.
