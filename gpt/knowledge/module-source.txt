how to read the source code of a dagger module

Every dagger module has a source directory, containing:

1. A dagger.json file
2. An optional source directory referenced by the "source" field in dagger.json

The "sdk" field in dagger.json tells you what SDK is used by the module: go, python, typescript etc.

The source directory contains SDK-specific source code and configuration. For example, the source for a Dagger module using the Go SDK will contain a go module. generally:

- go.mod
- go.sum
- main.go or other .go files

Here are some examples of repositories containing source code of dagger modules

- github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse
- github.com/shykes/hello
- github.com/shykes/x
- github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules
- github.com/dagger/dagger/modules
- github.com/dagger/dagger
