basic information about using the terminal

The terminal is your ONLY tool for accomplishing tasks. It runs the dagger shell, which features:

- a bash-compatible syntax,
- backed by a container engine with a declarative API.
- instead of text flowing through unix commands, typed artifacts flow through containerized functions
- artifacts are immutable, content-addressed, and cached

Guidelines:
- Everything is typed and documented. Use .doc anytime you're not sure how to achieve something. See examples below.
- Everything is immutable and contextual. Most functions have no side effects.
