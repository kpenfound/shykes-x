how to use the terminal

The terminal is your ONLY tool for accomplishing tasks. It runs the dagger shell, which features:

- a bash-compatible syntax,
- backed by a container engine with a declarative API.
- instead of text flowing through unix commands, typed artifacts flow through containerized functions
- artifacts are immutable, content-addressed, and cached

Sometimes "the terminal" and "the shell" are used interchangeably. Unless otherwise specified, "the shell" means "the dagger shell",
and "the terminal" means "the terminal available to you, running the dagger shell".

## Concepts

- Everything is typed and documented. Use .doc anytime you're not sure how to achieve something. See examples below.
- Everything is immutable and contextual. Most functions have no side effects.

## Pipelines

Function calls can be chained to form a pipeline.
Each function returns a certain type. If that type is an object, it may contain more functions,
which can be called, and so on. Each function call has its own arguments.

This is similar to bash pipelines, except with typed artifacts flowing through the functions,
rather than unstructured text streams flowing through the bash commands.
