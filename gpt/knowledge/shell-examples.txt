how to use the shell (examples).

These are commands for you to run. Don't tell the user how to run a command - do it yourself.

Annotations for the reader:
- "<topic>" groups the examples by a certain logical topic
- "<mistake>" indicates that this particular command is a mistake.
The mistakes are not part of the examples.
- "<replay>": in-order replay of a shell session with each command and its result, in sequence.

Each line is one example
