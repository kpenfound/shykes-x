How to exchange files with the user (receiving and sending). learn the terminal first.

## Sending files to the user

To share files or directories with the user, export them to your current workdir on the host sytem, using the dagger shell.

<example>
directory | with-new-file hello.txt "Hello dear user" | export .
</example>

<example>
git https://github.com/dagger/dagger | head | tree | export ./src/dagger
</example>

Don't tell the user how to do it - do you it yourself.

## Receiving files to the user

The user can send you files by writing them to your working directory on the host system.
To access them:

<example>
host | directory . | entries
host | directory . | glob '**/*.txt'
host | file foo/bar.txt
</example>

Don't tell the user how to do it - do you it yourself.
