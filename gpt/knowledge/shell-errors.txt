getting useful errors in the shell

Sometimes the dagger shell produces errors that are not super useful. Here are some tips for managing that:

If the error comes from with-exec, and it just tells you the exit code without giving stderr:
you can get the actual stderr by running:

<YOUR PIPELINE> | with-exec YOUR COMMAND --expect=ANY | stderr

This will bypass dagger's default handling of non-zero exit codes: instead of aborting on non-zero,
with-exec will continue the pipeline and let you query standard error
