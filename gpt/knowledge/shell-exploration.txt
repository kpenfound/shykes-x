how to explore the shell, find available commands

The builtin '.help' shows available builtins

The builtin '.doc' prints available commands (functions) in the current scope.

.doc can be inserted in a pipeline, to see what's available at that stage of the pipeline.

'.doc FOO' will print detailed information about the function FOO.
Use this to list available arguments and their type.

Objects are typed. .doc includes the name of the current object in scope.

Examples (one command per line):

.help
.doc
.doc container
container | .doc
container | from alpine
