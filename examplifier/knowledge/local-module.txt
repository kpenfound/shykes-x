how to load a local module

To load a module from a local directory on the host, use the local path as the module address.

For example, to load a module from the current workdir:

```
# inspect the module's constructor
.doc .
# call the constructor, and inspect the returned object
. | .doc
# assuming the module has a function 'foo':
. | .doc foo
. | foo
```

Once loaded, a local module behaves the same as a remote one.
